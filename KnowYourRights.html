<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="time-place-manner-regulations-1">Time, Place, &amp; Manner Regulations</h3>
<p>Courts apply three criteria in assessing the validity of time, place, or manner restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must be content-neutral, both facially and as applied.</li>
<li>They must be narrowly-tailored to protect a substantial government interest.</li>
<li>They must leave open alternative channels of communication to reach the intended audience.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="public-forum">Public Forum</h2>

</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="interacting-with-police">Interacting with Police</h3>
<p>It is generally a good idea to have someone designated to communicate with the police in the event they attempt to restrict 1st Amendment activity, or threaten/carry out arrests, during a demonstration.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may ask the police to explain any restrictions on the activity.</li>
<li>You may ask the police why participants have been arrested and where they will be taken following arrest.</li>

</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="interacting-with-police-1">Interacting with Police</h3>
<p>Even if the police do not provide satisfactory answers, or you believe they are infringing on your 1st Amendment rights, arguing with them is typically futile and may lead to being charged with resisting arrest or other criminal offenses.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="right-to-remain-silent">Right to Remain Silent</h3>

<h2 id="police-stops-detention">Police Stops &amp; Detention</h2>
<p>If you are stopped by a police officer, you are legally entitled to walk away unless you have been detained or arrested. If you’re unsure, you can ask if you are free to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is generally a good idea to walk away calmly.

</ul></li>
<li>It is generally not a good idea to argue with or insult the officer.
<ul>
<li>Even though your statements may be protected under the 1st Amendment, the officer is unlikely to be persuaded and is likely to react by detaining or arresting you.</li>

</ul>

<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="detention">Detention</h3>
<p>Detention means that you have been stopped by a police officer and are not free to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>Legally, a police officer is required to have “reasonable suspicion” that you are armed and dangerous before conducting a pat down.

<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="searches">Searches</h3>
<p>If you are detained but not arrested, the officer may not lawfully conduct any search beyond a pat-down (e.g. inside your pockets, under your clothing, inside a bag or other item) without your consent or “probable cause”.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may tell a police officer you do not consent to a search.
<ul>
<li>Refusal to consent is not probable cause for a search.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="probable-cause">Probable Cause</h3>
<p>Probable cause means that the officer has knowledge of facts sufficient to support a reasonable belief that you are engaged in criminal activity or have evidence of a crime in your possession.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">
