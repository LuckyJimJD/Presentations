# NC Property Protection Act 
## NCGS ยง 99A-2 (2015)

> Any person who intentionally gains access to the nonpublic areas of another's premises and engages in an act that exceeds the person's authority to enter those areas is liable to the owner or operator of the premises for any damages sustained.


*** 

### Nonpublic areas 

> ... those areas not accessible to or not intended to be accessed by the general public.

*** 

### Act that exceeds the person's authority to enter

> (1) An employee who enters the nonpublic areas of an employer's premises for a reason other than a bona fide intent of seeking or holding employment or doing business with the employer and thereafter without authorization captures or removes the employer's data, paper, records, or any other documents and uses the information to breach the person's duty of loyalty to the employer.


*** 

### Act that exceeds the person's authority to enter

> (2) An employee who intentionally enters the nonpublic areas of an employer's premises for a reason other than a bona fide intent of seeking or holding employment or doing business with the employer and thereafter without authorization records images or sound occurring within an employer's premises and uses the recording to breach the person's duty of loyalty to the employer.

*** 

### Act that exceeds the person's authority to enter

> (3) Knowingly or intentionally placing on the employer's premises an unattended camera or electronic surveillance device and using that device to record images or data.

*** 

### Joint Liability 

> Any person who intentionally directs, assists, compensates, or induces another person to violate this section shall be jointly liable. 

*** 

### Remedies 

- Equitable relief
- Compensatory damages
- Costs, and fees, including attorneys' fees 
- Exemplary damages of $5000 per day 

*** 

## Legislative Intent 

Codify holding in _Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc_., 194 F. 3d 505 (4th Cir. 1999) 

*** 

### Food Lion

- Reporters took jobs with Food Lion and made undercover recordings as part of expose. 
- Food Lion sued reporters for breach of employee duty of loyalty.
- Jury awarded $1 in damages.

*** 

### Food Lion

By secretly recording business operations to expose unsanitary and deceptive practices, while acting as employees, the reporters "did not serve Food Lion faithfully, and their interest ... was diametrically opposed to Food Lion's".

*** 

### Duty of Loyalty 

> [A]lthough our state courts recognize the existence of an employee's duty of loyalty, we do not recognize its breach as an independent claim. Evidence of such a breach serves only as a justification for a defendant-employer in a wrongful termination action by an employee.

_Dalton v. Camp_, 353 N.C. 647 (2001)

# Federal Labor Law 

*** 

## Protected Concerted Activity 

> Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection ... 

National Labor Relations Act, ยง 7  

*** 

### Concerted 

- Undertaken for the purpose of mutual aid and protection regarding terms and conditions of employment.
- Does not require that multiple employees are engaged in the activity.

*** 

### Protected 

It is an unfair labor practice for an employer "to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7".

NLRA, ยง 8(a)(1)

*** 

## Labor Pre-Emption 

State law may not regulate any activity that is arguably protected or prohibited under the NLRA.

_Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commn._, 427 U.S. 132 1976); _San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon_, 359 U.S. 236 (1959)

*** 

# Pre-Emption of NC PPA Suits

*** 

## Conflict with Federal Labor Law 

The conduct subject to liability under the NC Property Protection Act includes employee activity protected under the NLRA.

*** 

### Workplace Recording & Data Collection 

- Recording conditions in the workplace for the purpose of mutual aid and protection is protected.
- A broad employer policy against unauthorized recording are unlawful, if an employee could believe the policy applies to protected concerted activity. 

*** 

### Salting 

- Union members take jobs at non-union workplaces with the aim of organizing the employees. 
- Salting may be overt (the individual discloses their union affiliation when applying) or covert (the individual conceals their union affiliation). 
- Statutory protections under the NLRA apply to union salts if they are "genuinely interested in seeking to establish an employment relationship with the employer".
 
_NLRB v. Town & Country Elec., Inc_., 516 U.S. 85 (1995); _Toering Electric Co._, 351 N.L.R.B. 225 (2007) 

*** 

## Pre-Emption of PPA Suits 

- NLRA pre-emption will apply to a PPA suit based on protected concerted employee activity. 
- Because the NLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction to determine whether activity is protected, state courts may not decide that question in a PPA suit. 

*** 

## Unfair Labor Practice 

- It is an unfair labor practice for an employer to maintain a state court lawsuit against an employee or union for protected concerted activity. 
- The NLRB may order an employer to seek dismissal or a stay of a pending state court lawsuit, or seek an injunction for that purpose from a federal district court. 

_Can-Am Plumbing, Inc. v. N.L.R.B._, 321 F.3d 145, 151 (D.C. Cir. 2003);  _In Re Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc._, 331 NLRB 132 (2000); _In Re Manno Elec., Inc._, 321 NLRB 278, 297 (1996); _NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co._, 404 U.S. 138, 144 (1971)
