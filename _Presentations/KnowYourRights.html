<h3 id="time-place-manner-regulations-1">Time, Place, &amp; Manner Regulations</h3>
<p>Courts apply three criteria in assessing the validity of time, place, or manner restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">They must be content-neutral, both facially and as applied.</li>
<li class="fragment">They must be narrowly-tailored to protect a substantial government interest.</li>
<li class="fragment">They must leave open alternative channels of communication to reach the intended audience.</li>
</ul>

<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="public-forum">Public Forum</h2>
<p>1st Amendment protections are strongest in places traditionally open to unrestricted public speech &amp; activity.</p>

</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="interacting-with-police">Interacting with Police</h3>
<p>It is generally a good idea to have someone designated to communicate with the police in the event they attempt to restrict 1st Amendment activity, or threaten/carry out arrests, during a demonstration.</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">You may ask the police to explain any restrictions on the activity.</li>
<li class="fragment">You may ask the police why participants have been arrested and where they will be taken following arrest.</li>

<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="interacting-with-police-1">Interacting with Police</h3>
<p>Even if the police do not provide satisfactory answers, or you believe they are infringing on your 1st Amendment rights, arguing with them is typically futile and may lead to being charged with resisting arrest or other criminal offenses.</p>

<h2 id="police-questioning">Police Questioning</h2>
<p>In general, a police officer may lawfully ask you questions at any time, without having to demonstrate reasonable suspicion or probable cause. If you speak to a law enforcement officer, your statements may be used against you and others. It is a criminal offense to provide false information to a police officer.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="constitutional-rights-when-questioned-by-police">Constitutional Rights When Questioned by Police</h3>
<p>You have a right to refuse to answer police questions, and the right to consult with a lawyer before agreeing to speak to the police. These rights apply whether or not you have been detained or arrested.</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">But the police are not required to inform you of these rights unless they intend to conduct a custodial interrogation (i.e. question you while under arrest or otherwise not free to go).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="right-to-remain-silent">Right to Remain Silent</h3>
<p>You are not required to tell the police that you are exercising your right to remain silent.</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">But it is usually a good idea to do so.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="right-to-remain-silent-1">Right to Remain Silent</h3>
<p>Even if you answer some questions, you may still stop and refuse to answer any further questions until you have a lawyer.</p>
<p>You may not lawfully be arrested or punished for failing or refusing to answer police questions.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="right-to-counsel">Right to Counsel</h3>
<p>Police officers may try to pressure or persuade you to speak to them without a consulting a lawyer. Bear in mind that the police are legally permitted to lie to you.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="common-police-tactics">Common Police Tactics</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">They may say that you are better off without a lawyer.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">This is almost never true.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment">They may threaten you with a grand jury subpoena.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">They may be bluffing and even if they’re not, you are entitled to consult with a lawyer before testifying.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment">They may promise leniency in criminal charges or sentencing.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Criminal charges and plea bargains are up to the prosecutor, not the police.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="police-stops-detention">Police Stops &amp; Detention</h2>
<p>If you are stopped by a police officer, you are legally entitled to walk away unless you have been detained or arrested. If you’re unsure, you can ask if you are free to go.</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">It is generally a good idea to walk away calmly.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">If you run, or otherwise act in a “furtive” “suspicious” manner, the officer might use that as a pretext to detain or arrest you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment">It is generally not a good idea to argue with or insult the officer.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Even though your statements may be protected under the 1st Amendment, the officer is unlikely to be persuaded and is likely to react by detaining or arresting you.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="detention">Detention</h3>
<p>Detention means that you have been stopped by a police officer and are not free to go.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="detention-constitutional-rights">Detention: Constitutional Rights</h3>

</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="pat-downs">Pat-Downs</h3>
<p>If you are detained, the officer may conduct a “pat down” (an external check) for weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Legally, a police officer is required to have “reasonable suspicion” that you are armed and dangerous before conducting a pat down.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Police often cite “furtive” or “suspicious” movements or demeanor to justify a pat down.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="searches">Searches</h3>
<p>If you are detained but not arrested, the officer may not lawfully conduct any search beyond a pat-down (e.g. inside your pockets, under your clothing, inside a bag or other item) without your consent or “probable cause”.</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">You may tell a police officer you do not consent to a search.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Refusal to consent is not probable cause for a search.</li>
<li class="fragment">If the officer proceeds (which is likely), you do not have a legal right to physically resist.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="probable-cause">Probable Cause</h3>
<p>Probable cause means that the officer has knowledge of facts sufficient to support a reasonable belief that you are engaged in criminal activity or have evidence of a crime in your possession.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="arrests">Arrests</h2>
<p>Arrests, like searches, require probable cause.</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Police officers will usually tell you if you are being placed under arrest.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">If you are unsure, you may ask.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment">The officer will not necessarily inform you of the charges at the time of arrest.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="resisting-arrest">Resisting Arrest</h3>
<p>Resisting arrest is a crime, even if the arrest itself is unlawful or the police use excessive force in carrying out the arrest.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="search-incident-to-arrest">Search Incident to Arrest</h3>
<p>Once you have been placed under arrest, the police may lawfully conduct a search:</p>

<li class="fragment">The area within your immediate control.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="miranda-warning">Miranda Warning</h3>
<p>If you are arrested, the police may not lawfully interrogate you without advising you of your right to refuse to answer questions and your right to legal representation.</p>

</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="phone-call">Phone Call</h3>
<p>You have the right to make a phone call within a reasonable time after being arrested.</p>

<li class="fragment">But they may (and mostly likely will) listen to any other calls.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="court-appearance">Court Appearance</h3>
<p>You have the right to appear before a judge or magistrate within a reasonable time after being arrested (usually within 48 hours).</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The purpose of this appearance is to hear the formal charges against you, decide on bail, and enter a plea.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">You have a right to be represented by a lawyer at this and all other court appearances.</li>
<li class="fragment">If you can’t afford a lawyer, you have a right to be represented at no cost by a public defender or other court-appointed lawyer.</li>
